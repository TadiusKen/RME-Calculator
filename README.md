# RME-Calculator
Practitioners of magic utilize a resource known as mana to cast spells and perform magical feats. Mana is akin to a magical energy source that flows through the practitioner and the surrounding environment.

The Recommended Mana Efficiency (RME) calculator is a tool designed to evaluate how efficiently a magical circuit or system utilizes mana. Efficiency here refers to how effectively the mana is converted into desired magical effects, taking into account various factors such as the practitioner's skill, the condition of the magical circuit, and external influences.

Practitioners can input several parameters into the RME calculator, including:

    Mana Pool: The total amount of mana available to the practitioner.
    Output: The desired magical output or effect.
    Input: The amount of mana required to achieve the desired output.
    Coefficient of Mana Circuit: A factor representing the efficiency of the magical circuit or system.
    Variations in Flow: Factors affecting the consistency and stability of mana flow.
    Circuit Age: The age of the magical circuit or system.
    Sum of Magical Experience: A measure of the practitioner's accumulated magical experience, calculated as the product of their age and the length of time they have actively practiced magic.

Using these parameters, the RME calculator applies a fictional magic formula to determine the Recommended Mana Efficiency (RME) expressed as a percentage. This percentage indicates how efficiently mana is being utilized in relation to the practitioner's resources and experience.

Formula:

The fictional magic formula used in the RME calculator is as follows:

RME= (O-I/MP.C.VF) x (1-e - CA/SME) x 100%

MP is the Mana Pool.
O is the Output.
I is the Input.
C is the Coefficient of Mana Circuit.
VF is the Variations in Flow.
CA is the Circuit Age.
SME is the Sum of Magical Experience (Age Times Magic Active Length).

The formula combines technical aspects related to the mana circuit's efficiency (the first part of the equation) with experiential factors represented by the circuit's age relative to the practitioner's magical experience (the second part of the equation). The result is a percentage value indicating the recommended mana efficiency of the magical system.
